# Virtual Laboratory (QPSK Modulation)

This is a Virtual Laboratory where students can perform various **Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)** Wave Modulation experiments.

## Inputs

1. Digital data stream (Message Signal)
2. Carrier signal (High Frequency Signal)
   * Frequency
   * Peak to peak amplitude

## Outputs

1. Waveform of digital data
2. Carrier frequency waveform
3. Modulated waveform
4. Demodulated waveform (when Demodulation button is clicked)
